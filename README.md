The most common problem faced by students these days is related to attendance. They get short
of attendance because in the case of emergency, they are unable to send their leave application.
We generated an idea of creating an application which would solve all above stated problems.
Through a vast discussion, we came up with our web application. The idea breaks away from
traditional thought and creates a brand-new perspective. Our application mainly focuses on the fair
distribution of attendance among students.
This process is manual and it requires lot of attention by the students to maintain. Each department
will have its own coordinator who is responsible to maintain the whole process. It is difficult for
the coordinators to supervise the whole process manually. For this we are developing an
application which will be used for this purpose so that they can have an efficient mechanism to
monitor.
The goal of this project to is to create a system that will help students take leave. This system is
designed in such a way that it allows multiple users to access. It allows all students and take smartly
leave.
This application can be used in a college to reduce processing work load. This project’s main idea
is to develop an online centralized application connected to database which will maintain student
leaves, notices information. This application will reduce paperwork and maintain record in a more
efficient & systematic way. This module will also help to calculate the number of leaves taken
monthly/annually


In the existing paper work related to leave management, leaves are maintained using the attendance
register or leave application letter. The students’ needs to submit their leaves manually to their
respective proctors. This increases the paperwork & maintaining the records becomes tedious.
Maintaining notices in the records also increases the paperwork.
The main objective of the proposed system is to decrease the paperwork and help in easier record
maintenance by having a particular centralized Database System, where Leaves are maintained.
The proposed system automates the existing system. It decreases the paperwork and enables easier
record maintenance. It also reduces chances of Data loss. Using this system whenever required
any student can upload their leave application on their timeline which would then generate a
notification to the faculty or to the HOD about the leave and further which again would notify the
student about the leave is approved by the faculty or not. This will help to reduce the paper work
and loss of student’s attendance when they are not able to send the leave applications on time. The
application basically contains the given modules:
MODULE
1) Admin
2) Students
3) Staff
4) HOD

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The “Smart Leave Approval Web Application” is designed exclusively for the leave management
purpose. It is used to address the problem of continuous manual work. The main aim of this project
is to develop an application by which manual coordinating work is minimized. It also helps in
storing and retrieving the leave records for each student. It allows the coordinators to manage the
leaves process smoothly.

EXISTING SYSTEM
In the existing system everything is manual. Students are not able to inform in emergency time to
respective subjective teacher so that they facing attendance shortage. Students should give
application to proctor and HOD. It is difficult to maintain and some it can be lost. So, we developed
“Smart Leave Approval” system
